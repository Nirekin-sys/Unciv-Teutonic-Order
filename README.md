* Uniques
  * Furor Teutonicus [Furor Teutonicus]
  >Much of the Order's success was achieved by the dogged hardiness and robust faith of it's members. From the arid battlefields of the Middle East to the chilling forests of the Baltics, the Teutonic Order's holy and righteous mission was upheld by it's arduous disciples.
  
  * Teutonic Knight [Replaces Knight]
  >The Teutonic Knights bore the brunt and beared the weight for the challenges and dilemmas that the Order faced in it's route to glory and victory. They are not only a durable, but a versatile force to be reckoned with, trained in both mounted and infantry warfare. They are also the famed frontliners in the Order's eastern settling of the Northeast.
  
  * Ordensburg
  >The German castle-forts, called the Ordensburg, spearheaded the establishment and securing of the Teutonic Order's territories and homeland in the Baltics. Bigger, much more expansive and better manned than the normal Castle; the Ordensburg is a signature culture-piece of the Teutonic Order during their faithful ventures.
